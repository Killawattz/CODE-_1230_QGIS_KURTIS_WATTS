								<h1>Car Use</h1>
								<p>Due to expected nature it becomes quite clear  that the heaviest users of car travel lie within the areas further from the city, as the patches of land start to become lighter in colour and increase in proportion. Leaving the regions closer to the city mostly not using car travel, along with people living in close proximity to train stations, which becomes clear upon close inspection.</p>

								<h1>Car Use with Divide </h1>
								<p>This white line demonstrates the physiical seperation that divides the two uses's of space, visually demonstrating that the west use car travel a alot more than the east.</p>

							<div>
								<h1>Train </h1>
								<p>This represents the proportion of people using the train only, and it becomes clear that the people using the train purely are people that live along the train network, therfore have no use for the car in terms of work travel.   </p>

							<div>
								<h1>Car and Train </h1>
								<p>This graph presents a more interesting layout deomstrating a higher separation of individual user groups as it vaguely displays the proportion of those that live in close promximity but not directly on the train line. It actaully separtes the people that wotk within the Sydney region from the people that don't highlighting various suburbs around sydney that don't have easy access to a train line and therfore drive to the station. Suburbs such as Liverpool, Campbelltown, Penrith, Hornsby, etc.</p>

							<div>
								<h1>Train and Bus </h1>
								<p>This graph presents another interesting layout but presents similar results in a more skewed manner in comparison to the other findings. Most people partake in this method live within fairly close proximity to central sydney area, again following that train line network slightly. It demonstrates that most people within these areas completely rely on public transport which makes sense as public transport facilities within these areas are quite sufficient. </p>
